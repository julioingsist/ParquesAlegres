What is Facebook fan page?

A Facebook fan page is nothing but a platform where celebrities get to interact with their 

fans directly. It is also a platform where businesses can reach out to their customers on a 

one-on-one basis. A Facebook fan page can only be created by an authorized aide of the 

celebrity or the business and so is genuine and trustworthy. The pages are often used to 

make announcements – both personal and professional, promote new business offers and 

so on. 

A Facebook fan page is different from a Facebook group. A group on Facebook can 

be started by anyone and the content can be limited or made public. There also are 

restrictions on the people who join it. A Facebook fan page, on the other hand, can only 

be started by authorized personnel of the celeb or the business. There usually isn't a 

limit on the number of people who can like the fan page. However, the privacy can be 

controlled the fans can be added after they are screened. 

The fan pages on Facebook are better than the personal profiles for artists or 

organizations. This is because the pages can be customized to a great extent and altered 

to make it more sellable. Many apps can be added and the entire platform can be made 

more interactive, and these are elements that work effectively to make the page a success. 

Facebook fan pages can also be used as internet marketing tools. On one page, you can 

place links of other pages (by liking them) and thus build up a link-sharing network. This 

will further improve your chances of making the page successful on Facebook.

News feed is a great way to popularize your Facebook page. When a user logs in, the 

updates from friends, apps and pages appear on their news feed. If you, as the page 

admin, regularly post on the page's wall, the story will show in the news feed of all the 

people who have liked the page. And if, in turn, they like the story, it will appear in the 

ticker of their friends. This way more and more people can be directed to the Facebook 

fan page and help in the increase of its popularity. 

Even though there isn't a limit on the number of people who can like a Facebook fan 

page, you can control and restrict the fans (the people liking a fan are usually known as 

the fans). If you find some people spamming on the wall or posting indecent material or 

using foul language, you can ban them from the page. This can be done by following a 

few simple steps. Similarly, you also have to power to remove and report wall posts and 

comments. This gives you the authority to control the content of the page and customize 

it as per your requirements. 

A Facebook fan page allows you to get a rough idea of your popularity. Though not 

always bankable, the data collected from these pages can give some insight into the 

success of a business or celebrity. There are graphs that can be read to determine the 

number of people who liked the page, the number of people who unliked it, the number 

of subscriptions, unsubcriptions, and so on. A lot of businesses, specially movies and 

artists use this data to understand the growing popularity of something that has been 

newly released. 

A Facebook fan page is a great way for a celebrity or organization to represent 

themselves in the world of social networking. And since this is the main objective of a 

page on Facebook, great care should be taken to name the page. An insignificant, far-
fetched name won't help in popularizing the page. Most commonly pages are directly 

named after the celebrity or the business. This can be done while setting the page up as 

Facebook gives you the option of choosing a username (much like doing so while signing 

up for a new email ID) for the fan page. 

So it can be seen how a Facebook fan page can be created and used to maximum 

benefit. A Facebook fan page is a great way to connect with fans directly. With the 

increased influence of media, and sometimes harmfully so, a Facebook fan page is a great 

broadcasting tool. If you need to promote yourself or your business, consider creating a 

page on Facebook. It is easy to start, easy to maintain and works wonderfully to increase 

your popularity. Many people have already benefited and so everyday we get to see more 

and more fan pages on Facebook.



About facebook from wikipedia:
Facebook is an online social networking service. Its name comes from a colloquialism for the directory given to American university students. Facebook was founded in February 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities before it opened to high-school students, and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over. Facebook now allows anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old to become a registered user of the website.
Users must register before using the site, after which they may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, exchange messages, and receive automatic notifications when they update their profile. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". As of September 2012, Facebook has over one billion active users, of which 8.7% are fake. Facebook (as of 2012) has about 180 petabytes of data per year and grows by over half a petabyte every 24 hours.
In May 2005, Accel partners invested $12.7 million in Facebook, and Jim Breyer added $1 million of his own money. A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users. Entertainment Weekly included the site on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers' birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing game of Scrabulous before Facebook?" Facebook eventually filed for an initial public offering on February 1, 2012; it is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Facebook Inc. began selling stock to the public and trading on the NASDAQ on May 18, 2012. Based on its 2012 income of US$5.1 billion, Facebook joined the Fortune 500 list for the first time on the list published in May 2013, being placed at position 462.
